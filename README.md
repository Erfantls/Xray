# Xray
This is a simple GUI client for [`XTLS/Xray-core`](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core)  
Also you can use it independent of Xray-core just for your socks proxy (Like SocksDroid)

# Limitations
- You can only have 1 Xray-core configuration
- You must provide the config only in JSON format
- Link configs (ex vmess://) are not supported
